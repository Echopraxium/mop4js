MOP (Meta Object Protocol) for Javascript

Prototype of MOP for Javascript within the scope of ES6 syntax (e.g. without decorators). There is reference works on this domain, especially MOOP (PERL) and JOOP (Javascript). Regarding MOP (Meta Object Protocol), this paradigm is there for a while (since 1991 at least, see "The Art of the Metaobject Protocol" which describes CLOS, a MOP for LISP). So my ambition is first to "learn by doing" (then eventually share a naive and lightweight implementation), second to promote the usage of MOP in JS community.
